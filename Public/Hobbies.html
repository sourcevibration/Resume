<h1>Have fun!</h1>
<p>That's what I'm doing. As much as possible. I'm learning not to take too serious what the gods has made for fun. That's a quote I can't remember where comes from.</p>
<p>Otherwise I really love to use my body, it's a fantastic vehicle for exploration. I love spending time in nature and spend time in communion. Travelling is high on the list too, I try to do it as often as I can and I have been blessed with some really beautiful journey.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the whole idea with this is to incorporate my hobies into jobs starting with creating things like this!</p>
<p><center>To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower <br>
    Hold infinity in the palm of your hand <br>
    And Eternity in an hour </center></p>
